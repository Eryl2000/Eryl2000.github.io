<h1>Eryl Kenner</h1>
<p>
Extremely passionate about all things problem solving. I currently work as a software engineer for Intel developing validation software for their SSD technology. My past work includes several fun games I built using the Unity game engine, including one which won 1st  place in the Games category for the 2018 Reno's Biggest Little Hackathon event. I also created my own game engine in C++ using the Ogre graphics engine, and have worked as an embedded programmer and as an artificial intelligence researcher. I love the problem-solving and mathematical aspects of software development and always welcome a difficult problem to crack.
