<h1>Eryl Kenner</h1>
<p>
I am extremely passionate about games, game development, and the technology that goes into it. I have experience using the Unity game engine to make several games, including one which won the Games category for the 2018 Reno's Biggest Little Hackathon event. I love the problem-solving and mathematical aspects of software development and have created my own game engine using the Ogre graphics engine. I have also worked as an embedded programmer and as an artificial intelligence researcher.
